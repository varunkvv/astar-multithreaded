The astar folder contains a multithreaded (for parallelism) Java implementation of the A* algorithm. 
I wrote this code a couple of weeks ago, to learn the threads API in Java.
The A* algorithm is essentially a path finding algorithm, variations of which are commonly used for AI in strategy games. 
For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm.
